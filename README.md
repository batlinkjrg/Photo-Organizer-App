This app is to sort photos and vidoes into a structure kinda like this

<Custom Path>/Sorted Media/2023/(1) January/23/photo.jpg

Supported formats right now are: jpg, png, gif, heic, mp4, mov, avi

Usage:
1. Pick input directory and output directory
2. Select Optional Actions
        - sortNoDate -> will sort photos if no valid date is found by using file creation/modified date
        - moveFile -> moves the file into their new sorted directory instead of just copying it
        - screenshotFilter -> filters screenshots out by filename
3. Pick a name for the output directory (Default: Sorted Media)
